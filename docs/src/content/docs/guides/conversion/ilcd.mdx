ILCD+EPD is a widely used digital EPD format. LCAx allows you to convert ILCD+EPD files into LCAx EPDs.

## ILCD+EPD

ILCD+EPD is a format for digital EPDs, which contain machine-readable EPD information stored in an XML format that can
be used by building LCA tools. \
ILCD is a widely used data format developed by the European Commission.[<sup>1</sup>](https://www.eco-platform.org/eco-epd-40.html)

Even though ILCD+EPD originally was created as an XML data structure it can also be exported as JSON data,
which is what LCAx converts.

## ILCD+EPD Providers

Several platforms used ILCD+EPD as their underlying data structure.
The following platforms provide data in the ILCD+EPD format:
- [ECO Portal](https://www.eco-platform.org/epd-data.html)
- [Ã–kobau](https://www.oekobaudat.de/en.html)
- [EPD Norway](https://www.epd-norge.no/)

## Code Example

In the following example we will take a look at how easy it is to convert an ILCD file into LCAx:

<CodeVariants variants={[
    {label: 'Python', code: ilcdPY, lang: 'py', title: 'convert_ilcd.py'},
    {label: 'TypeScript', code: ilcdTS, lang: 'ts', title: 'convertILCD.ts'},
    {label: 'Rust', code: ilcdRS, lang: 'rs', title: 'convert_ilcd.rs'},
    {label: 'Data', code: ilcdJSON, lang: 'json', title: 'ilcd.json'},
]}/>
