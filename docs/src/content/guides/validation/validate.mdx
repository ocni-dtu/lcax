LCAx's validation engine enables users to define and run custom rules to on a LCAx project.

The `validate` function takes in a LCAx project and a list of validation rules (`ValidationSchema`) to check the project against.

A validation schema should contain the following three properties:

#### `ValidationSchema`

**level:** `'project' | 'assembly' | 'product' | 'impactData'` \
**field:** `string` \
**rule:** `ValidationRule`

The fields are:

- `level`: The four levels corresponds to LCAx's [data structure levels](/concept/data-structure) and the value determines where the rule should be applied.
- `field`: Which field the rule should be applied to. If the field is optional (meaning it can be null), then a `?` should be added to the name.
- `rule`: The validation rule to apply.

#### `ValidationRule`

**range:** `[number, number] | null` \
**includes:** `string | null` \
**required:** `boolean | null` \
**equal:** `string | null` \
**greater:** `number | null` \
**less:** `number | null` \
**oneOf:** `string[] | null`

The fields are:

- `range`: Check that a field has a value between two numbers.
- `includes`: Check that a field (of a string or a list) includes a certain value.
- `required`: Check that a field is not null or empty.
- `equal`: Check that a field is equal to a value.
- `greater`: Check that a field is greater than a value.
- `less`: Check that a field is less than a value.
- `oneOf`: Check that a field has one of the values.

## Simple Project Validation

In the example below we make a simple validation that the project's name is equal to `Test eksempel`.

When all validation rules pass the `validate` function will return `true`.

<CodeHighlightTabs
  code={[
    { fileName: 'validate.py', code: validateSimplePY, language: 'py' },
    { fileName: 'validate.ts', code: validatesimpleTS, language: 'ts' },
    { fileName: 'validate.rs', code: validateSimpleRS, language: 'rs' },
    { fileName: 'project.json', code: projectJSON, language: 'json' },
  ]}
/>

## Validation Errors

If the validation is not successful then the `validate` function will throw an error, containing information on the failed fields.

In this example we will validate that the project's name is equal to `Te eksempel`, which it is not.

<CodeHighlightTabs
  code={[
    { fileName: 'validate_error.py', code: validateErrorPY, language: 'py' },
    { fileName: 'validateError.ts', code: validateerrorTS, language: 'ts' },
    { fileName: 'validate_error.rs', code: validateErrorRS, language: 'rs' },
    { fileName: 'project.json', code: projectJSON, language: 'json' },
  ]}
/>

## Nested and Optional Fields

In this example we want to validate that the location of the project is in Denmark.
That information is in `location.country` and we can create a validation rule that checks that the field is equal to `dnk` (LCAx uses ISO3166-3 to represent countries).

We also want to validate that the gross floor area of the project is greater than 50, so we create a rule for that.
Since `projectInfo` is an optional field (meaning it can be null), we have to include `?` in the field name.

<CodeHighlightTabs
  code={[
    { fileName: 'validate_nested.py', code: validateNestedPY, language: 'py' },
    { fileName: 'validateNested.ts', code: validatenestedTS, language: 'ts' },
    { fileName: 'validate_nested.rs', code: validateNestedRS, language: 'rs' },
    { fileName: 'project.json', code: projectJSON, language: 'json' },
  ]}
/>
