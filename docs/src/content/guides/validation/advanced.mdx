In the previous section we saw how simple rules can be built using code.

Sometimes when you want to create more elaborate validation schemas it might an advantage to so in text.
For this you can i.e. use [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML), which has a more readable syntax than fx. JSON.

## Using YAML to Define Rules

In the example below we create an elaborate set of validation schemas in YAML.
In the code examples when then read the YAML file and pass the validation schema objects to the `validate` function.

<CodeHighlightTabs
  code={[
    { fileName: 'validation_rules.yaml', code: validationRulesYAML, language: 'yaml' },
    { fileName: 'validate.py', code: validateYamlPY, language: 'py' },
    { fileName: 'validate.ts', code: validateyamlTS, language: 'ts' },
    { fileName: 'validate.rs', code: validateYamlRS, language: 'rs' },
    { fileName: 'project.json', code: projectJSON, language: 'json' },
  ]}
  syncKey='lang'
/>

## Validation JSON Schema

If you wish to write your validation rules in YAML, you can then use the JSON Schema
for the validation to provide help and feedback on the available fields.

If you use an editor like VS Code or PyCharm to write your YAML you can plug the validation JSON schema in there.

You can find the validation JSON schema [here](/reference/schemas/validation).
