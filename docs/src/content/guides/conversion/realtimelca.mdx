## Real-Time LCA

Real-Time LCA is an online application that allows users to evaluate the environmental impact of buildings.
Real-Time LCA integrates directly with common BIM and CAD software such as Revit, Rhino and ArchiCAD.[<sup>1</sup>](https://realtimelca.com/en-us)

## Exporting Files from Real-Time LCA

In the video below you can see how to export an XLSX file from Real-Time LCA.

Real-Time LCA doesn't have a native export format that includes the complete LCA model, which is why we parse the BR Standard Format file.
Not that this format is only available for projects in Denmark.
