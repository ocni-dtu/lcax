## EPD

Let's imagine that you have downloaded an ILCD formatted EPD. \
You can now convert it using LCAx's converter:

<CodeHighlightTabs
  code={[
    { code: convertIlcdPY, language: 'py', fileName: 'convert_ilcd.py' },
    { code: ilcdJSON, language: 'json', fileName: 'ilcd.json' },
  ]}
/>

It is now possible to access the impact data on the EPD object.

<CodeHighlightTabs
  code={[
    { code: epdImpactsPY, language: 'py', fileName: 'epd_impacts.py' },
    { code: ilcdJSON, language: 'json', fileName: 'ilcd.json' },
  ]}
/>

You can also save the EPD as a LCAx formatted JSON file and load it back into Python memory.

<CodeHighlightTabs
  code={[
    { code: epdDumpsLoadsPY, language: 'py', fileName: 'epd_dumps_loads.py' },
    { code: ilcdJSON, language: 'json', fileName: 'ilcd.json' },
  ]}
/>
