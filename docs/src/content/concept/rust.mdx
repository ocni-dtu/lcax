![LCAx Packages](/lcax_embed.svg)

Rust allows for cross-compiling LCAx into multiple languages, notably the most commonly used ones in the AEC industry:
Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, and C#.

While most AEC professionals are unfamiliar with Rust, the choice of Rust was made to be able to create packages in the
languages that most AEC professionals are familiar with while also recognizing that not everyone writes code in the same
language.

On top of the cross-compiling capability, Rust is also an extremely fast language, comes in handy when processing large
LCA projects or large quantities of LCA projects for i.e., conversion, verification, and calculation.

Compared to C, which offers many of the same features in terms of cross-compiling and speed, Rust is a modern
programming language with modern tooling baked in.
Even though it is a low-level language, it has a high-level feeling to it and especially Python developers will find the
syntax familiar.
