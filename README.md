# LCAx

The goal for LCAx is to make an open, machine and human-readable data format for exchanging LCA results,
EPD's and assemblies. 

We propose a simple three level data format with information on project, assembly and EPD level,
written in an open data format and paired with a validator for a more robust and standardized format.
We intend to create connections to existing tools and APIâ€™s.
